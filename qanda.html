                    <h4>A</h4>
                    <p>Currently, because the application is still in beta, you will get access to all the pro videos and all the ads will be removed. Once we release the final application, some features will only be available if you have purchased the app. The price will also increase.</p>

                    <p>"Why does videos take so long to export?"</p>
                    <h4>A</h4>
                    <p>Only export the part of the video which you would like to analyze (your swing). The length of you video will determine the time it will take to save/export your video. We can make the video export faster, but the video quality will suffer.</p>

                    <h4>Q</h4>
                    <p>"Why is backward seeking 'choppy' when I analyze a video which was not imported?"</p>
                    <h4>A</h4>
                    <p>The short answer - that is how video works. The tecnical answer - A video is made out of groups of pictures (GOP), this GOP contains different frames (I, P and B frames), we are only interested in the I-frames. The I-frame contains the full frame and the P and B frames contain the info to construct the I-frame. When seeking backwards, we need to seek to the previous I-frame, then seek forward (get the info from the P and B frames) to the frame we are looking for. When seeking forward, this is not neccesary, thus the faster seeking.</p>
                    <p>When importing/saving a video, we increase the GOP which results to faster, more accurate seeking.</p>

                    <h4>Q</h4>
                    <p>"Why does my device not support video comparison?"</p>
                    <h4>A</h4>
                    <p>We use an API called MediaCodec to display videos. Most devices only support 2 instances of this API.
                     Other applications also use this API, like your camera or other video players. Please make sure that you close this 
                    applications before trying to compare a swing. If you still can't open a second video in the swing comparison screen 
                    then your device only supports one instance of MediaCodec at a time.</p>
