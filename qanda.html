                    <h4>A</h4>
                    <p>Currently, because the application is still in beta, you will get access to all the pro videos and all the ads will be removed. Once we release the final application, some features will only be available if you have purchased the app. The price will also increase.</p>

                    <p>"Why does it take so long to import/save a video?"</p>
                    <h4>A</h4>
                    <p>You should only save the part of the video which you would like to analyze (your swing). You can do this by adjusting the video trimmer, please see "Saving Videos". The length of your video will determine the time it will take to save/export. By doing this, the waiting time will drastically be decreased.</p>

                    <h4>Q</h4>
                    <p>"Why is backward seeking 'choppy' when I analyze a video which was not imported?"</p>
                    <h4>A</h4>
                    <p>The short answer - that is how video works. The tecnical answer - A video is made out of groups of pictures (GOP), this GOP contains different frames (I, P and B frames), we are only interested in the I-frames. The I-frame contains the full frame and the P and B frames contain the info to construct the I-frame. When seeking backwards, we need to seek to the previous I-frame, then seek forward (get the info from the P and B frames) to the frame we are looking for. When seeking forward, this is not neccesary, thus the faster seeking.</p>
                    <p>When importing/saving a video, we increase the GOP which results to faster, more accurate seeking.</p>

                    <h4>Q</h4>
                    <p>"Why does my device not support video comparison?"</p>
                    <h4>A</h4>
                    <p>ProGolf uses an API called MediaCodec for displaying videos. Most devices only support 2 instances of this API and some only one.Â Other applications, like your camera or a video player app, might also be using this API. Please close these applications before trying to compare a swing. If you still can't open the second video in the swing comparison screen, then your device only supports one instance of MediaCodec at a time. Unfortunately, if this is the case, there is nothing to be done about it..</p>
